# Codex Context Proxy

A visual, editable context layer for Codex. Let AI edit AI's context with surgical precision, giving you more control and freedom over what Codex sees.

## What We Built

Codex Context Proxy gives the official Codex CLI a visual and editable context layer.

Codex is powerful in long coding sessions, but its context can become hard to inspect and harder to maintain. Tool logs, failed attempts, outdated assumptions, and repeated transcript fragments can keep accumulating. When that happens, you usually cannot see exactly what Codex is about to read or selectively remove noisy context before the next response.

This project adds a local context editor in front of Codex. You keep using the normal Codex workflow, while the proxy captures Codex's live context and opens a workbench where you can visualize, edit, compress, and delete context before future responses.

In short:

```text
Codex writes code.
Codex Context Proxy helps maintain Codex's context.
```

## What Codex Gets

- Context visualization: see the conversation, tool history, and context nodes Codex is about to use.
- Editable context: compress, delete, or rewrite selected context items.
- AI context editing: use a second AI pass to maintain the main AI's context.
- Precise compaction: replace blunt auto-compact with targeted context surgery.
- CLI and Desktop support: use it with Codex CLI, with experimental support for Codex Desktop.
- Normal workflow: continue using Codex from the terminal or desktop app.

The context editing workbench is adapted from HashCode. The original project explains the broader "AI edits AI's context" idea in more detail:

## Features

### Live Context Map

Codex Context Proxy converts a Codex session into a structured context map. Instead of treating the transcript as one long wall of text, it shows user turns, assistant turns, tool calls, tool results, and edited context nodes as separate items.

### AI-Assisted Context Editing

You can select noisy or outdated context and ask an editor model to compress, rewrite, or clean it up. This makes it possible to preserve useful intent while removing bulk from logs, failed attempts, or repeated information.

### Manual Context Control

Not every context edit needs AI. You can also remove selected nodes or inspect raw content manually.

### Codex CLI and Desktop

Codex CLI support is the main path. Once enabled, the normal `codex` command starts the local proxy and context window before launching the real Codex CLI.

Codex Desktop support is also included. It can point Codex Desktop's model provider configuration at the local proxy so desktop conversations can use the same editable context layer. Desktop support touches local Codex configuration, so it is controlled separately from the CLI switch.

### Transparent Workflow

When the proxy is off, `codex` passes through to the official Codex CLI. When the proxy is on, the same `codex` command starts the local proxy, opens the context window, and then launches the real Codex CLI.

## How It Works

Codex Context Proxy runs a local Responses API compatible proxy.

When Codex sends a request, the proxy captures the request body and response stream, then builds a canonical transcript for the context workbench. If you do not edit anything, requests are forwarded transparently and Codex behaves like normal.

When you edit the context, the proxy marks that session as overridden. On the next Codex turn, it rebuilds the Responses `input` from the edited transcript and removes server-side chained context references that would bypass the local edit.

High-level flow:

```text
codex
  -> local shim
  -> Codex Context Proxy
  -> official Codex request
  -> OpenAI / ChatGPT Codex backend

context window
  -> visualize transcript
  -> edit selected nodes
  -> save edited context
  -> next Codex turn uses edited context
```

## Quick Start

Download and run the Windows installer:

```text
Codex Context Proxy Setup 0.2.0.exe
```

After installation, open a new terminal and enable the proxy:

```powershell
codex ctx proxy on
```

Use Codex normally:

```powershell
codex
```

Disable the proxy anytime:

```powershell
codex ctx proxy off
```

Check status:

```powershell
codex ctx proxy status
```

Remove the shim:

```powershell
codex ctx proxy uninstall
```

### Codex Desktop

Desktop support is controlled separately:

```powershell
codex ctx desktop on
```

Check Desktop proxy status:

```powershell
codex ctx desktop status
```

Disable Desktop proxying:

```powershell
codex ctx desktop off
```

Desktop support is more experimental than CLI support because it modifies local Codex configuration instead of only adding a command shim.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run the local Codex flow:

```powershell
npm run codex
```

Run only the context window:

```powershell
npm run window
```

Run type checks:

```powershell
npm run typecheck
```

Build the Windows installer:

```powershell
npm run dist:win
```

The installer is generated at:

```text
release/Codex Context Proxy Setup 0.2.0.exe
```

## Notes

- This project does not replace Codex.
- It does not require modifying the official Codex CLI source code.
- It works by adding a local editable context layer in front of Codex.
- Codex Desktop support is more experimental than Codex CLI support.
